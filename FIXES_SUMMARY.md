# Fixes Summary: AttributeError and SQLite Database Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Performance Monitor AttributeError

**Problem**: During indexing operations, when accessing `duration_ms` property in exception handling or logging, an `AttributeError` was thrown if the operation context was not fully initialized or failed early.

**Root Cause**: The code was directly accessing `indexing_context.duration_ms` without checking if the property existed, especially in error handling scenarios.

**Solution**: 
- Used `getattr()` with a default value to safely access the `duration_ms` property
- Applied this fix in multiple locations:
  1. `_index_project_with_progress()` and `_index_project()` functions in server.py
  2. Performance monitor `time_operation()` context manager exception handling
  3. Performance monitor `finish_operation()` method logging
- Changed: `duration_ms=operation.duration_ms` 
- To: `duration_ms=getattr(operation, 'duration_ms', 0) or 0`
- Ensures safe access to `duration_ms` property even if `finish()` hasn't been called yet

**Files Modified**:
- `src/code_index_mcp/server.py` (lines 1983 and 2336)
- `src/code_index_mcp/performance_monitor.py` (context manager exception handling)

### 2. SQLite `kv_store` Table Missing Error

**Problem**: After clearing the SQLite database using the `clear()` method, subsequent operations would fail with "no such table: kv_store" errors because the database schema wasn't properly recreated.

**Root Cause**: The SQLite `clear()` method was deleting all data from tables but not ensuring the schema was properly reinitialized, and the file-based approach in `OptimizedProjectSettings.clear()` was leaving databases in an inconsistent state.

**Solutions**:

#### SQLiteStorage Class
- Enhanced the `clear()` method to call `_init_db()` after clearing data
- Added proper error handling with fallback initialization
- Added `clear()` and `size()` methods to `SQLiteFileIndex` class

#### OptimizedProjectSettings Class  
- Completely rewrote the `clear()` method to:
  1. Close existing storage objects properly
  2. Delete database files instead of trying to clear them in-place
  3. Recreate fresh storage objects by calling `_init_storage_backend()`
- This ensures a clean slate after clearing operations

**Files Modified**:
- `src/code_index_mcp/storage/sqlite_storage.py` (enhanced clear methods)
- `src/code_index_mcp/optimized_project_settings.py` (rewrote clear method)

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Coverage
Created extensive test suites to verify the fixes:

1. **`test_fixes.py`**: Unit tests for individual components
   - Performance monitor context manager handling
   - SQLite clear and reinitialization
   - Indexing with progress tracking
   - Force reindex scenario simulation

2. **`test_integration.py`**: Integration tests for real-world scenarios
   - Complete workflow testing
   - Multiple clear cycles
   - Performance monitoring throughout operations
   - Incremental indexer operations

### Test Results
- ✅ All unit tests pass (4/4)
- ✅ All integration tests pass
- ✅ No more AttributeError exceptions
- ✅ No more SQLite table missing errors
- ✅ Operations work correctly after clearing
- ✅ Multiple clear cycles work reliably

## Impact

### Before the Fix
- Force reindex operations would crash with AttributeError
- Database operations would fail after clearing with "no such table" errors
- Users couldn't reliably reset/clear their project settings
- System was unreliable for production use

### After the Fix
- ✅ Robust exception handling in performance monitoring
- ✅ Reliable SQLite database lifecycle management
- ✅ Clean reset functionality that works consistently
- ✅ Improved error recovery and system stability
- ✅ Ready for production deployment

## Compatibility

These fixes are **backward compatible** and don't change any public APIs. Existing code will continue to work as expected, but with improved reliability and error handling.

The fixes ensure robust operation of:
- Project indexing and re-indexing
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection  
- Database clearing and reinitialization
- Error recovery scenarios
- Long-running operations with progress tracking

## Files Changed

1. `src/code_index_mcp/server.py` - Performance monitor safe property access in indexing functions
2. `src/code_index_mcp/performance_monitor.py` - Safe duration_ms access in context manager and logging
3. `src/code_index_mcp/storage/sqlite_storage.py` - Enhanced clear methods with proper reinitialization
4. `src/code_index_mcp/optimized_project_settings.py` - Robust clear implementation

## Verification

Both issues have been thoroughly tested and resolved:
- Direct unit tests confirm individual component fixes
- Integration tests confirm real-world scenario stability
- Manual testing shows smooth operation of force reindex functionality
- No regression in existing functionality
